    <<~EOS
      Sinkzone is a DNS-based productivity tool designed to reduce distractions and help you focus.
      It works by running a local DNS resolver that intercepts domain name queries. During focus
      sessions, only domains explicitly allowed via the allowlist will resolve — everything else
      is silently blocked.

      Features:
      - Local DNS resolver for network-level blocking
      - Focus mode with configurable duration
